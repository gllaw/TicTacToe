Hello, this is for playing Tic Tac Toe against the computer in your console.

Unfortunately, if I've done things right then you shouldn't be able to win.

My condolences. 

Please have Ruby installed and navigate to this file's directory in your terminal.

Navigate to the example folder and run "ruby test_script.rb" to play.
